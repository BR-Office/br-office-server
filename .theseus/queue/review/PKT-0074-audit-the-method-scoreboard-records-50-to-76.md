## Goal
Audit the method over scoreboard records 50 to 76, following `.theseus/prompts/auditor.md`. Write the report to `.theseus/audits/AUD-3.md` and any proposals to `.theseus/proposals/TEP-<n>.md`.

## Essential context
- Planned by `theseus plan`: `audit.every_n_packets` is 20 and the scoreboard has 76 records.
- Packets: `.theseus/scoreboard/packets.jsonl`. Friction: `.theseus/scoreboard/friction.jsonl`. Queue and packet logs: `.theseus/queue/`.
- The agents' run folders (prompt, final report, acceptance log of every attempt) are in `.theseus/scoreboard/runs/`.
- Work the audit finds missing in the project (not in the method) is requested with `theseus packet new`, as any out-of-scope work.
