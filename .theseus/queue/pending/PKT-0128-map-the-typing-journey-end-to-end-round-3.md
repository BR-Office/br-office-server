## Goal
Map the user journey `typing` (Type in an open Word document: key press to the character drawn on screen) end to end, as users meet it, against the integrated build: the project's main branch and the forks' collecting branches, not the installed package (which runs the original code). If `.theseus/oracle/serve-integrated.sh` does not exist, write it: it brings that build up and down on this machine. Make `bash .theseus/oracle/journeys/typing.sh` work: it runs the journey several times against the integrated build and prints one line `total_ms=<p50> min_ms=<min> max_ms=<max> runs=<n>`. Then write `.theseus/journeys/typing.md` with `goals_hash: dcb03039`, `round: 3` and `total_ms: <p50>` in its header, and a machine-readable ```yaml block: `stages:` (each with `id`, `module` (a module id of the adapter, or `project`), `files`, `functions`, `ms` and `share` in percent) and `unattributed_ms`. Break the journey down from the user's action to the last pixel: every stage the time goes through, in every module, with the files and functions that spend it (a stage above 5% of the total names its functions). The stages and `unattributed_ms` add up to `total_ms` within 5%. Round 3: compare with the earlier map if there is one.

## Essential context
- Planned by `theseus plan` from `goals.journeys` in the adapter. Every module's next diagnosis must cover every stage you give it, so name the module of each stage with the ids of `modules` in the adapter.
- `.theseus/oracle/baseline.md` and `.theseus/oracle/rounds/` hold the measurements made so far: evidence to cite, not a substitute for measuring.

## Suggested plan

## Executor log
- return: factory restarted on Theseus 0.24.2 (quiet journey measurement)
